This package's aim is to provide a versatile and efficient feedback particle filter implementation in Julia, with abstractions to flexibly construct, run, and analyze feedback particle filters for a variety of uni- and multivariate filtering problems with both diffusion and point process observations.

In particular, the following features are planned to be implemented in FeedbackParticleFilters:
* Types for hidden state and observation models: diffusions, Poisson processes, etc.
* A variety of gain estimation methods
* Automatic filter deployment and simulation of the state and filtering equations
* Storing of intermediate (trajectory) data from simulation
* An interface to the powerful solvers from the [DifferentialEquations](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl) package 

## Installation

Use the built-in package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("FeedbackParticleFilters")
```

## Usage

To load the package, use the command:
```julia
using FeedbackParticleFilters
```
Set up a basic one-dimensional linear-Gaussian continuous-time filtering problem:
```julia
using Distributions
state_model = ScalarDiffusionStateModel(x->-x, x->sqrt(2.), Normal())
obs_model = ScalarDiffusionObservationModel(x->x)

filt_prob = ContinuousTimeFilteringProblem(state_model, obs_model)
```
Once the filtering problem is defined, you can use it to perform a variety of tasks.

For example, you may initialize an ensemble of `N=100` particles:
```julia
ensemble = FPFEnsemble(state_model, 100)
```
The following generates a Poisson equation for the gain using the ensemble above.
The equation is solved using the semigroup gain estimation method.
```julia
eq = GainEquation(state_model, obs_model, ensemble)
method = SemigroupMethod1d(1E-1,1E-2)
Solve!(eq, method)
```
The gain at the particle locations is stored in `eq.gain`.
These low-level building blocks can then be used to write custom numerical implementations.
The package also comes with methods to automatically simulate given filtering problem:
```julia
filter = FeedbackParticleFilter(filt_prob, method, 100);
simulation = FPFSimulation(filter, 10000, 0.01);
run!(simulation)
```
